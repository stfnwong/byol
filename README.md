##### *An artists impression of a typical SCIP reader in the wild*

This is me following the [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) book and building a LISP. 

## Requirements 
- For now using the provided MPC parser combinator library.
- libedit
- Makefile specifies gcc 

## TODO :
Lots. I also want to write my own parser combinator library but who knows when that will happen. 

There are currently no unit tests.
