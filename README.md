##### *An artists impression of a typical SCIP reader in the wild*

This is me following the [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) book and building a LISP. I did this because I wanted to go through 
[SCIP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and figured why not start from scratch?


## Requirements 
- For now using the provided MPC parser combinator library.
- libedit
- Makefile specifies gcc. I'm using GNU `getline()` at the moment.


## TODO :
Lots. 

There are currently no unit tests.
